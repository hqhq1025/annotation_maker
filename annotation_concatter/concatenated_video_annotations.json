On the table are three different types of glassware—a couple of wine glasses and a smaller plain glass—in an arrangement. A person pours water from a large container with a blue lid into one of the wine glasses, then into the other. As the container is emptied, it is set back on the table. The person then picks up one of the wine glasses and a small plain glass and proceeds to pour water from the wine glass into the smaller one, transferring the liquid between the two glasses before placing both back onto the table. The video captures the sequence of pouring and transferring water, emphasizing the movement of hands and the gradual filling of the glasses. The container, now empty, is also placed back on the table towards the end."
