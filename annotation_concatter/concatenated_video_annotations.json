The main activities in the video involve a person’s hand which enters the frame multiple times to perform various actions with playing cards.\n\nInitially, the hand places three cards face down in a row on the surface. The individual then flips each card to reveal them one by one: a nine of clubs, a queen of diamonds, and a seven of clubs. After this, the hand maneuvers the cards in various patterns, shuffling their positions several times. Through the shuffling process, the focus remains on the hand movements and the cards, ensuring clarity in the card manipulation actions.\n\nThroughout the video, the human hand is the key dynamic element, while the backdrop and objects remain stationary. The visual style stays straightforward, concentrating on the identifiable actions of handling and revealing playing cards without any additional effects or embellishments."
